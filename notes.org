<2022-10-19 Wed 18:53>: We can use the concept of using 'seeds' to seed data to our database using Rails.

I made the following modifications to the 'app/db/seeds.rb' file:
#+begin_src ruby
# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# NOTE: This is the first way we used .create() to create individual 'seed' data:
# Pet.create(name: "Timmy", breed: "Siamese")
# Pet.create(name: "King", breed: "Tabby")
# Pet.create(name: "Lucy", breed: "Siberian")

# Another way to use .create() in a 'seeds' file is to provide an array of hashes to the .create() method itself
# with corresponding symbol values:
Pet.create([{name: "Timmy", breed: "Siamese"},
    {name: "King", breed: "Tabby"},
    {name: "Lucy", breed: "Siberian"}
])
#+end_src

I then ran the 'rake db:seed' to run the seeding process:
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-4/phase-4-lecture-videos-seeds/pet-shop $ rake db:seed

The dependency tzinfo-data (>= 0) will be unused by any of the platforms Bundler is installing for. Bundler is installing for ruby but the dependency is only for x86-mingw32, x86-mswin32, x64-mingw32, java. To add those platforms to the bundle, run `bundle lock --add-platform x86-mingw32 x86-mswin32 x64-mingw32 java`.
#+end_src

I then confirmed this by using the 'rails console' command accordingly followed by using '.all()' method on the 'Pet' class itself, as well as '.all.length()'

NOTE: The alias for 'rails console' is also 'rails c':
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-4/phase-4-lecture-videos-seeds/pet-shop $ rails console
